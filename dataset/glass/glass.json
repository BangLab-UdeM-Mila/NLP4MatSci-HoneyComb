            "Rhombohedral structural Ca3CoMnO6 was prepared. The microstructure, chemical composition, morphology were checked and the magnetic properties were investigated in detail. Due to the order-by-disorder phenomenon, the ZFC curve presents negative susceptibility in low temperature region. Besides the antiferromagnetic transition around TN=13.5K, another abnormal peak around T f =172K was also observed. The shift of the abnormal peak towards low temperature with the field increases, magnetic relaxation experiment and the training effect confirm the freezing spin glass characteristic. The broadening of the freezing peak in higher field can be well explained by the reduction of short-range magnetic correlation length. Due to the competing antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions, obvious exchange bias effect was observed.",

            "Chalcogenide glasses are interesting materials due to their infrared transmitting properties and photo-induced effects exhibited by them. Thin films of the glasses Sn10Sb20 x Bi x Se70 (0 x 8) prepared by melt quenching technique were evaporated in a vacuum better than 105 mbar. Optical transmission spectra of all the deposited films were obtained in a range 4002500nm. The optical band gap and the absorption coefficient were calculated from the transmission data and refractive index was calculated using the swanepoel method. The optical band gap initially increases with increase in Bi content (for x =2) and then decreases sharply for higher Bi concentrations. The refractive index as well as absorption coefficient decrease with increase in wavelength. The dark activation energy initially increases with increase in Bi content and then decreases with further addition.",

            "Praseodymium doped TeO2BaF2NaF glasses were prepared by conventional quenching melt technique. Optical absorption spectra have been investigated using JuddOfelt (JO) theory. Radiative transition probabilities and branching ratios were calculated. The branching ratios for the 1D23F4 and 3P03F2 emission transitions are above 40%. The fluorescence of Pr3+ in the visible bands was observed under 325nm pumping. The energy transfer and concentration quenching have been discussed. The 1D2 emission quenches much faster than those of 3P0 due to the cross-relaxation between 1D21G4 and 3H43F4 transitions, which provides an appropriate interpretation for the red shift of emission band around 600nm. The decay curves of 3P0 level are measured. In 0.5mol% Pr3+ doped sample, we obtained maximum lifetime is 21.5s. The prepared glasses are potential candidates for laser applications.",

            "In this study, the influence of the glass addition and sintering parameters on the densification and mechanical properties of tetragonal zirconia polycrystals (3Y-TZP) ceramics were evaluated. High-purity tetragonal ZrO2 powder and La2O3-rich glass were used as starting powders. Two compositions based on ZrO2 and containing 5wt.% and 10wt.% of La2O3-rich glass were studied in this work. The starting powders were mixed/milled by planetary milling, dried at 90C for 24h, sieved through a 60mesh screen and uniaxially cold pressed under 80MPa.

The amount and size of B2-CuZr nanocrystallites precipitated from the glass matrix increase with enhancing the pre-compression stress, which suggests that the appropriate pre-compression treatment promotes the formation of metallic glass matrix composites (MGMCs). The 850MPa pre-compressed MGMC possesses the highest compressive fracture strength (1814MPa) and a certain degree of plasticity, as well as the larger hardness of 700HV. The 1415MPa pre-compressed MGMC with more B2-CuZr nanocrystallites demonstrates advantages in thermal stability and corrosion resistance in the seawater solution. It shows the higher corrosion resistance with the most positive corrosion potential and the lower corrosion current density than the other tested samples. These can be attributed to the structural homogeneity after appropriate precipitation of nanocrystallites.",

The transition is found to be second-order and purely strain-induced, driven by a soft shear acoustic mode propagating along a <110 and polarized along a (110) crystal direction. Such pure-strain transitions were previously discussed by Anderson and Blount and the transition in paratellurite is the first observation of this kind of transition. No evidence was found for any coupling of the soft mode to any other acoustic or optic mode, although small anomalies associated with lattice strains accompanying the transition were observed in some of the elastic and dielectric constants. Analysis of the effective elastic constant C, governing the soft mode velocity indicates that, within experimental uncertainty, the transition can be described by mean-field theory. Although the apparent attenuation of the soft mode increased significantly near the transition, it is concluded that this effect is probably due to the fact that the phase and group velocities are not parallel rather than to intrinsic dissipative processes in the crystal. With the exception of C44 , the remaining elastic constants and Raman-active phonon frequencies displayed normal increases with pressure. No soft Raman-active modes were observed in either phase. The static dielectric constants 1 are large, due to the large electronic polarizability of TeO2, and the anisotropy in  results almost entirely from the anisotropy in the optical dielectric constants . In the low pressure tetragonal phase both a and c exhibit normal temperature dependences and c decreases with pressure; however, a exhibits an anomalous increase with pressure.

Methods Acid-washed, woven, fused silica-glass fibers, were heat-treated at 500C, silanized and sized with one of two sizing resins (linear poly(butyl methacrylate)) (PBMA), cross-linked poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Subsequently the fibers were incorporated into a polymer matrix. Two test groups with fibers and one control group without fibers were prepared. The flexural properties of the composite reinforced with linear PBMA-sized fibers were evaluated by 3-point bend testing before thermal cycling. The specimens from all three groups were thermally cycled in water (12,000 cycles, 5/55C, dwell time 30s), and afterwards tested by 3-point bending. SEM micrographs were taken of the fibers and of the fractured fiber reinforced composites (FRC). Results The reduction of ultimate flexural strength after thermal cycling was less than 20% of that prior to thermal cycling for composites reinforced with linear PBMA-sized silica-glass fibers. The flexural strength of the composite reinforced with cross-linked PMMA-sized fibers was reduced to less than half of the initial value. Significance This study demonstrated that thermal cycling differently influences the flexural properties of composites reinforced with different sized silica-glass fibers. The interfacial linear PBMA-sizing polymer acts as a stress-bearing component for the high interfacial stresses during thermal cycling due to the flexible structure of the linear PBMA above T g. The cross-linked PMMA-sizing, however, acts as a rigid component and therefore causes adhesive fracture between the fibers and matrix after the fatigue process of thermal cycling and flexural fracture.",

In this study, to improve the thermal resistance of asphalt pavement, hollow glass microspheres (HGM) modified asphalt and HGM/Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene (SBS) modified asphalt were used to prepare asphalt concrete (AC) and stone mastic asphalt (SMA) respectively. The effects of HGM on the penetration, ductility, softening point and rheological properties of asphalt binder and the cooling performance, mechanical property, high temperature stability, low temperature resistance, water stability and other properties of asphalt mixture were investigated. Finally, the composition of the thermal resistance surface layer was recommended. Results showed that, adding HGM increased the high temperature stability of both matrix asphalt and SBS modified asphalt while the low temperature performance of both the two types of asphalts decreased. For the asphalt mixture, the addition of HGM improved the cooling performance of the AC-13 mixture but had no effect on the cooling performance of the SMA-13 mixture. HGM also showed positive effects on the pavement performance of the asphalt mixtures. For the AC-13 mixture, it improved the mechanical property, high-temperature stability, low-temperature cracking resistance and immersion residue stability but had no effect on the thaw-splitting strength ratio (TSR). For the SMA-13 mixture, it improved the Marshall stability, high-temperature stability, immersion residue stability, scattering resistance while impaired the low-temperature crack resistance, TSR and anti-drainage ability.

In TGA analysis, the change of properties is function of temperature with heating rate as constant or as a function of time with constant temperature (and/or constant mass loss). It provides information about physical phenomena, such as second-order phase transitions, along with characteristics like desorption, sublimation, absorption, and vaporization. DSC analysis is that the difference in the amount of heatrequired to increase temperature of a sample and reference is measured as a function of temperature. TGA provides information regarding physical properties such as vaporization, sublimation, absorption, adsorption and chemical properties like chemisorptions, desolvation, decomposition.

However, it is shown that the energy dependence of the self-energy, not included in a local potential, is important for determining quasi-particle energies away from the Fermi surface, such as the top of the majority spin band in nickel. This energy dependence is also essential for understanding the low temperature behaviour of the spin susceptibility of paramagnetic metals.

The lasing efficiency of the prepared glasses has been characterized by the spectroscopic quality factor (4/6), the value of which is in the range of 0.21.5, typical for Nd3+ in different laser hosts.

            "The fast relaxation in glass-forming substances is often identified with the -relaxation of the idealized mode coupling theory (MCT), which involves a critical temperature, T c, higher than the glass transition temperature, T g. However, several recent experimental works indicate that the fast relaxation may not be so simply described. These findings include the breakdown of the predictions of the idealized MCT below T c in 0.4Ca(NO3)20.6KNO3 (CKN) and ortho-terphenyl (OTP), the existence of the fast relaxation also in crystalline OTP, and the flat dielectric susceptibility minimum (i.e., nearly frequency independent or constant loss) observed in CKN and propylene carbonate at temperatures below T c. These experimental facts indicate that the fast relaxation observed below T c is outside the predictions of the idealized MCT and a recent two-component schematic model of MCT, which includes hopping. It is unlikely that this non-MCT fast relaxation existing below T c will abruptly vanish at temperatures above T c. The need for an alternative model of the fast relaxation not only below but also above T c is thus clear. We analyzed susceptibility spectra of many glass-formers with the assumption that the susceptibility minimum is caused by a temperature dependent near constant loss. Good fits to the susceptibility spectra were obtained and in the process the near constant loss was determined as a function of temperature. When compared in a plot against T g-scaled temperature, the near constant losses of different glass-formers exhibited a pattern that correlates with the stretch exponent,  (T g), of the KohlrauschWilliamsWatts (KWW) function which describes the time dependence of the structural -relaxation at T g. The correlation suggests that the fast relaxation and the slow structural -relaxation are both determined by the same factor, which we attribute to the anharmonic intermolecular potential of interactions between the molecules. The fast relaxation is suggested to be the relaxation of a vibration by anharmonicity. The vibration is likely the one that attempts to relax the structure of the glass-former.",

However, due to the crack bridging mechanism produced by the randomly distributed copper short fibers, the MGMC does not catastrophically fail by a single shear band propagating across the whole monolithic sample. In the supercooled liquid region of the metallic glass, the MGMC shows large elongation to failure but fails by cavitation due to the preexisting Ni-based crystalline powders.",

The intense and broad absorption band of Cr3+ provides a selective pump scheme for obtaining an efficient 2.0m emission of Ho3+, the OH absorption coefficient, on the other hand, is decreased as low as 1.08cm1, which both highly conducive to obtain an intense 2.0m emission of Ho3+. In addition, the crystal-field parameter D q /B of Cr3+-doped glasses is also calculated to study the influence of BaF2 on the local environment of activators and sensitizers. Further theoretic calculation shows that the largest absorption and emission cross-sections of Ho3+ near 2.0m are as high as 4.6 and 5.2 (1021 cm2) in the 10mol% BaF2 modified Cr3+/Ho3+ co-doped glass and the maximum energy transfer efficiency from Cr3+ to Ho3+ is about 42.5%.

The dc conductivity (dc), crossover frequency (H), frequency exponent (n) and power law exponent (s) have been computed from the best fitted plots of experimental data. We have estimated the values of activation energy of ac conduction (Eac) and free energy of polaron migration (EH). Dc conductivity of the as-prepared samples shows thermally activated nonlinear nature, which has been interpreted with VogelTammannFulcher (VTF) model. From the fitting, pseudo activation energy (Ea) and thermodynamic ideal glass transition temperature (T0) have been estimated. Nature of variation of conductivity and the power law exponent (s) data exhibit that nonoverlapping small polaron tunnelling (NSPT) model is suitable to interpret these data for compositions x=0.3, 0.5 and 0.7. On the other hand, correlated barrier hopping (CBH) model is most applicable mechanism for ac conduction for compositions x=0.9 and 0.93. Formation of some complex Mo-O-V structures may be possible reason for applicability of CBH model for composition x=0.9, 0.93.

After an electric field is applied across the chalcogenide glass, carriers can tunnel directly from the electrodes onto the appropriately charged defect centers. This leads to the appearance of potential barriers near the contacts, resulting in a rapid decay of the current.

The adhesive systems and the composite (Filtek Z350XT, 3M-ESPE) were inserted into the mold. After 7 days stored in a humid environment, the specimens were sectioned into five slices (Isomet 1000, Buehler). Hourglass slices were trimmed and subjected to microtensile bond strength testing (BISCO; Schaumburg, USA) with 0.5mm/min crosshead speed. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and the Tukey test (SPSS 17.0, =5%). Results The microtensile bond strength (MPa) means (standard deviation) were G1=9.46(3.79), G2=6.27(3.21), G3=9.35(3.91), and G4=10.13(3.53).

Conclusion GIC etching promoted higher microtensile bond strength with universal adhesive than with a total-etch adhesive system. Acid etching is not necessary to enhance the universal adhesive bond strength and negatively affected the bond strength of the total-etch adhesive system.

One of the drawbacks for rubber toughening of polymers is the severe reduction in tensile properties (i.e. tensile modulus and tensile strength). With the incorporation of SGF into ternary SGF/rubber/PET blends, the resulting blends may possess attractive tensile and impact characteristics. From this research, it was observed that SGF is effective in improving the tensile modulus, tensile strength and notched impact strength in the SGF/PET binary blends. However, the presence of MA-g-SEBS rubber in the SGF/rubber/PET blends did not improve the notched impact strength, while the tensile properties were adversely affected.

Structural and crystallization behaviour of glassy and heat-treated powders was evaluated. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of the powders showed transition from amorphous to nanocrystalline phase at 800K. Magnetic evaluation of the bulk glassy cores revealed best soft magnetic property at a sintering temperature of 775K which was due to the formation of -Fe(Si,Al) and Fe3(Si,Al) nanoparticles evidenced by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray analysis. However, at this temperature the glassy compact exhibited low value of remanence, which was attributed to the demagnetization field due to porosity in the material that developed from the escaped mineral binder. At subsequent higher sintering temperature of 785K the glassy core exhibited inferior soft magnetic properties with a low coercivity due to the formation of strongly anisotropic boride phases. Remanence value increased due to reduced demagnetization effect arising from a more compact morphology. Such reduced porosity was due to the coalescence of powder particle as observed from scanning electron microscopy (SEM).",

This paper aims to investigate damage mechanisms developing within the material during fatigue test in order to understand the origin of this phenomenon. Two in-situ non-destructive techniques were used in order to detail the fatigue damage scenario: namely, acoustic emission and infrared thermography. These techniques allow locating and differentiating the main damage mechanisms: matrix cracking, fibre/matrix debonding and fibre breakages. In addition, microscopic observations and synchrotron X-ray microtomography were realized on fatigue coupons to visualize fibre breakages.

Additionally, a proper understanding of the reinforcing mechanisms, if any, affecting the mechanical properties of ceramics containing carbon nanotubes is still lacking. We report here the effects of a good dispersion of as much as 10wt.% multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on the mechanical properties of dense alumino-borosilicate glass ceramics (ABS) prepared by an ultrasonication-assisted solgel technique followed by hot pressing (950C; 2h; Ar atmosphere). The fracture toughness and flexural strength of the nanocomposites increased with increasing MWCNT content up to 10wt.%. The ABS10wt.% MWCNT nanocomposite possessed nearly double the strength of the unreinforced ABS, accompanied by 150% improvement in fracture toughness. However, a further increase in MWCNT content to 15wt.% resulted in a modest deterioration of the mechanical properties due to agglomeration of the MWCNTs. The carbon nanotubes have been observed to bridge crack openings of the order of 100nm and the experimental evidence, along with theoretical analysis, showed that crack bridging provided the major contribution towards the improvement in fracture toughness. Debonding between the MWCNTs and the matrix appeared to occur in the matrix, away from the actual interface. However, the absence of significant pull-out of broken sections of the MWCNTs during fracture, due to failure of the bridging CNTs being predominantly at the crack plane, indicates that further toughening may be available if this mechanism can be activated.",

Under UV-light excitation the 0.5 mol% ZANP glass show a yellowish white light emission and in order to obtain white light emission, the Dy3+/Eu3+ co-doped ZANP glasses with fixed Dy3+ concentration (0.5 mol%) and varied Eu3+ concentration (0.11.5 mol%) were synthesized. The energy transfer phenomenon between Dy3+ and Eu3+ ions was studied based from the emission spectra with different excitation wavelengths and the decay curves of the 4F9/2 level of Dy3+ ion. The energy transfer efficiency () and energy transfer probabilities (Pda) are calculated for Dy3+/Eu3+ co-doped ZANP glasses. The energy transfer probabilities are linear with the acceptor (Eu3+) concentration confirming the fact that the dipoledipole interaction is responsible for the energy transfer (ET) process of Dy3+Eu3+ ion. The chromaticity co-ordinates were calculated from emission spectra of Dy3+/Eu3+ co-doped ZANP glasses with different excitation wavelengths. These results show that the white light has been achieved by exciting Dy3+/Eu3+ co-doped ZANP glass with ultraviolet or blue light.",

In intra ply hybrid patches glass and Kevlar fibre reinforcements are combined in the same layer. The intention, in using these hybrid patches, is to combine the excellent mechanical properties of glass fiber as a brittle reinforcement with the superior high elongation to failure property of Kevlar fiber as a ductile reinforcement. Five different kinds of plain weave woven fabrics with different ratios between glass and Kevlar fibers (100/0, 75/25, 50/50, 25/75 and 0/100) were used as the external patches. The undamaged virgin specimens were taken as a reference for the comparison of residual mechanical properties. Multiple quasi-static indentation tests were carried out on repaired glass/epoxy specimens, and their ultimate indentation load, stiffness and permanent deformation were estimated. Failure mechanisms of repaired glass/epoxy specimens under indentation loads were investigated using online Acoustic Emission (AE) monitoring technique. The indentation loads required for the occurrence of various failure modes were measured to illustrate the chronology of progression of different damage modes with increasing load and the kinetics of the various damage modes individually defined in real time. The use of different hybrid patches had a significant effect on the local bending response of the repaired glass/epoxy specimens. In practice, specimens repaired with patches including equal volume fraction of glass and Kevlar fibers presented a more favorable indentation response than virgin ones and other repaired specimens by exhibiting balanced mechanical properties (i.e., high deflection to ultimate failure associated with superior patch-parent laminate bond strength).",

Its good mechanical properties deteriorate with time. This phenomenon has been studied performing a tensile test program on both young and aged samples of GRC produced by using different chemical additives. Once the tests were carried out, a microstructural analysis of fracture surfaces was performed using a scanning electronic microscope (SEM). Pictures taken showed that the addition of metakaolin enables more fibers to be pulled out from the matrix instead of being broken in aged GRC samples. However, the increase in the number of such fibers pulled out did not prevent the embrittlement of GRC. Also, all the other chemical additions used did not show any improvement in the mechanical properties of GRC.",

The effects of B content, Ti content, and the brazing temperature on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the brazed joints were investigated. The typical interfacial microstructure of the brazed joint was: Al2O3/Ti3(Cu, Al)3O/Ag(s.s)+TiB+Ti(Cu, Al)+fine AlCu2Ti/blocky AlCu2Ti+AlCuTi/TiAl. TiB whiskers synthesized in situ by the reaction of the B additive with Ti, served as nucleation sites for the formation of fine Ti(Cu, Al) and AlCu2Ti grains and improved the bonding properties. With increasing B content, more fine-grains were formed in the brazing seam and the thickness of the Ti3(Cu, Al)3O reaction layer adjacent to the Al2O3 ceramic decreased. Brazing parameters also influenced the joint microstructure. Growth of Ti3(Cu, Al)3O layer and AlCu2Ti formed with increase in brazing temperature. Moreover, the formation of dispersed fine-grains in the brazing seam depended largely on the initial Ti content in the composite filler. With increase in initial Ti content, the TiB-reinforced area was broadened while the blocky AlCu2Ti content decreased gradually. The maximum shear strength of Al2O3/TiAl joint brazed with B-reinforced composite filler was 148MPa, which was 246% higher than that brazed without B addition. The joint shear strength was determined by the combined influences of the thermal expansion mismatch between the joined materials, the thickness of the Ti3(Cu, Al)3O layer, and the presence of defects in the joints.",

Quasi-static indentation tests were conducted on a comprehensive set of scaled Quasi Isotropic (QI) S-glass/8552 epoxy and QI IM7-carbon/8552 epoxy laminates, comparing changes in both in-plane dimensions and fully three-dimensionally scaled cases. Due to the higher thickness of the S-glass laminates, the mechanical results were normalized by a thickness scaling rule to have a fair comparison between the mechanical behaviour. The results demonstrated that the shape of the load-displacement of the S-glass/epoxy laminates is similar to that of the IM7-carbon laminates, with evident changes in rigidity appearing due to the onset and propagation of delamination and final failure caused by fibre breakage. The S-glass/8552 epoxy laminates had smaller load drops, higher deflection and higher mechanical energy absorption before failure compared to the IM7-carbon/8552 epoxy laminates. X-ray computed tomography scanning revealed that delamination is the dominant failure mode for the investigated laminates, and the shape of delamination was influenced by the ply angles at the interfaces. Comparing the glass and carbon laminates, ultrasonic C-scan results indicated similar delamination damage size for the initiation stage, however the damage size was found to be dependent on the fibre properties and layup sequence in the propagation stage.",

This technique has been exploited to investigate the distribution of 4f states of the rare earth metals. The spectra reflect the transitions of the N4,5 (4d) electrons to the unoccupied 4f states. These states split into a multiplet as a result of the exchange interaction between the 4f electrons and 4d holes. Multiplicity of this configuration depends upon the number of 4f electrons. A systematic study of the spectral features of rare earth series metals does not reveal any regular or orderly changes, unlike the spectra of 3d transition series metals. These results confirm that the spectra of rare earths are amenable to interpretation in terms of the atomic-like transitions involving exchange interaction rather than in terms of the continuous interband transitions.

This is in contrast to the single relaxation time behaviour expected at short relaxation times/high frequencies in phase-space models and also contrary to the reported general behaviour of simple glass-formers.

The electron-phonon coupling constants (g), phonon energies (h) and the multiphonon relaxation rates (WMPR) were determined. The decay curves of 5D0 level of Eu3+ in all the studied glasses exhibit single exponential nature. The lifetimes are obtained from the decay curves and reported.

The results showed that significant strength improvement was achieved after 2 h of exposure to 800 C, despite of the size of the aggregates that was used. Up to 200% strength increment can be achieved for GC-AAC mortars with selected aggregate size. Meanwhile, Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) based specimens were prepared for comparison and detrimental strength loss was observed. Microstructural analysis indicated that the improved mechanical properties after the high temperature test was attributed to the denser paste formed as a result of recycled glass aggregates annealing as well as the better bonding between the paste and the aggregates. Microhardness test showed that the heated AAC paste had significantly higher stiffness than the original paste before the elevated temperature exposure.",

            "The compressive and tensile deformation, as well as the fracture behavior of a Zr59Cu20Al10Ni8Ti3 bulk metallic glass were investigated. It was found that under compressive loading, the metallic glass displays some plasticity before fracture. The fracture is mainly localized on one major shear band and the compressive fracture angle,  C, between the stress axis and the fracture plane is 43. Under tensile loading, the material always displays brittle fracture without yielding. The tensile fracture stress,  F T, is about 1.58 GPa, which is lower than the compressive fracture stress,  F C(=1.69 GPa). The tensile fracture angle,  T, between the stress axis and the fracture plane is equal to 54. Therefore, both  C and  T deviate from the maximum shear stress plane (45), indicating that the fracture behavior of the metallic glass under compressive and tensile load does not follow the von Mises criterion. Scanning electron microscope observations reveal that the compressive fracture surfaces of the metallic glass mainly consist of a vein-like structure. A combined feature of veins and some radiate cores was observed on the tensile fracture surfaces. Based on these results, the fracture mechanisms of metallic glass are discussed by taking the effect of normal stress on the fracture process into account. It is proposed that tensile fracture first originates from the radiate cores induced by the normal stress, then propagates mainly driven by shear stress, leading to the formation of the combined fracture feature. In contrast, the compressive fracture of metallic glass is mainly controlled by the shear stress. It is suggested that the deviation of  C and  T from 45 can be attributed to a combined effect of the normal and shear stresses on the fracture plane.",

In agreement with experiments, our simulations predict that  L(T) is negative at low temperatures up to T  150 K. In this low-temperature regime, the simulation results are in quantitative agreement with experiments. To elucidate the origin of the negative thermal expansion, we analyze in detail the microscopic mode Grneisen parameters in the system and show that the anomalous behavior of  L(T) can be related to the fact that the Grneisen parameters for the lowest modes become negative at low temperatures  i.e., the lowest eigenfrequencies become stiffer with increasing volume.",

The question of whether a phase transition below (or above) the glass transition temperature, T g, exists is considered. The result that the glass transition temperature and jumps in the dynamic heat capacity and volume expansion coefficient can be calculated if the relevant frequency-dependent linear response functions are known makes the question of the origin of non-Debye relaxation even more important. In effective medium theories, certainly valid at high temperatures, non-Debye relaxation is apparently due to dynamic effects of interactions. At lower temperatures, energy disorder is larger compared with kT, and percolation-based theories may be more appropriate. The question as to the actual magnitude of disorder in energies cannot be conclusively resolved at this time. Certainly, it has been shown that systems exist in which non-Debye relaxation is due exclusively to disorder but, in many systems, an important component of the energy disorder is a manifestation of the influence of topological disorder on interactions. Thus, in these systems, an increase in the magnitude of dynamic interactions relative to kT accompanies the increase in the disorder. The question as to whether universal properties imply universality in the mechanism of non-Debye relaxation is explored in some depth. The present article reaches the tentative conclusion that the relative importance of disorder and interactions may be dependent on the type of glass considered, and possibly even on specific systems. Certainly, the relative importance of dynamic interaction effects increases as the frequency of an applied force is reduced. If their respective influences crossover in importance at some finite frequency, , the relevant question is whether  is above, at, or below the relaxation peak frequency, . If universality exists, it relates to the role of disorder, but such a conclusion would require that    c always, the generality of which has not been established.",

This trend is consistent between the pure resin and the fibre composite for all treatments, except at 90C/24h.

Now-a-days, metals are replaced with composites owing to their higher strength to weight ratio and are extensively used in aircraft wing and fuselage structures. These structures are subjected to high strain rates during impact loadings, such as bird hit or run-way debris impact. In order to design robust composite structures, it is important to understand the strain-rate-dependent behavior of composite materials. In this study, influence of strain rate on the tensile properties of glass/epoxy, carbon/epoxy and hybrid (glass-carbon/epoxy) composites are experimentally and theoretically investigated in the range of strain rates from 0.0016 s1 to 542 s1. Drop mass setup is used for high strain rate tests. Quasi-static tests are performed on Instron universal testing machine in accordance with ASTM D638. The results indicate that the tensile strength and tensile modulus of GFRP and hybrid composites increase and percentage of failure strain for GFRP, CFRP and Hybrid composites decreases with the increase in strain rate, whereas tensile strength and tensile modulus of CFRP composites remains approximately constant. The scanning electron microscopy is used for analyzing the failure modes of the failed region (surface) of the tested specimens. Non contact DIC system is used to capture the strain field with the help of high speed camera.",

The emission intensities of the most intense green band have been enhanced on the co-doping with theYb3+ ions with about 5.92 and 3.99 times upon 980 and 808nm excitations, respectively.

The glass forming ability (GFA) of this system is evaluated by the m ,  and  parameters and the alloys containing 4 and 6at.% were found to be the best glass formers in this system. The temperature interval of the supercooled liquid region (Tx ) changed with Cr and was enlarged from 35K at x =0 to 50K at x =4. Corrosion rates measured by immersion tests in H2SO4 decreased with an increase of chromium content in the alloys. The electrochemical measurements indicate that the alloys containing more than 4at.% of Cr are spontaneously passivated with low current densities in 0.1N H2SO4 whereas the alloys with Cr content <4at.% showed transpassive Mo dissolution. In view of these results, the optimal amount of Cr addition in FeMoCB amorphous steels is discussed.",

For the all-para-connected homopolymer, the presence of crystallinity had a significant influence on the calorimetric glass transition properties of the amorphous phase: T g was offset by as much as 20C in the crystallized samples as compared to the wholly amorphous material, and a sizeable (W RAP  0.30) rigid-amorphous-phase fraction was observed. In the copolymers, crystallinity had only a very minor effect on T g. The rigid-amorphous-phase fraction in the copolymer samples was smaller as compared to the homopolymer, and was negligible (W RAP  0) for samples prepared under less-restrictive crystallization conditions. Dielectric studies indicated progressive mobilization of the rigid-amorphous-phase fraction above T g for the copolymer samples, with full mobilization of the non-crystalline fraction observed for those samples crystallized at the highest temperatures. These results show that the introduction of 1,3-connected isophthalate moieties in the PEKK copolymers has a disrupting influence on the persistence of crystalline constraint into the amorphous phase. Similar observations have been reported for poly(phenylene sulfide) copolymers and thermoplastic polyimides that incorporate meta-phenylene linkages in the chain backbone.",

Significant pile-ups (or surface upheavals around indents) and shear bands were observed at low stress levels less than 244 MPa and disappeared with an increase of the tensile stress. From a 3D morphological viewpoint, the tensile stress in elastic regime is understood to be beneficial to the surface formability of the Zr-based BMG, because the tensile stress invokes deeper indentations with slight elastic recovery and reduces the irregular pile-ups with shear bands.",

Four different samples are considered: three with a 2, 4 and 6 nm radii precipitate and a precipitate-free sample. These systems are submitted to uniaxial tensile test up to 25% of strain. The interface region between the precipitate and the glass matrix has high local atomic shear strain, activating shear transformation zones, which concentrates in the neighborhood of the precipitate. The plastic regime is dominated by necking, and no localized shear band is observed for the samples with a 4 and 6 nm radii precipitate. In addition, the yield stress decreases as the size of the precipitate increases. Regarding the precipitate structure, no martensitic phase transformation is observed, since neither the shear band hit the precipitate nor the stress provided by the tensile test is enough to initiate the transformation. It is concluded that, in contrast to the case when multiple precipitates are present in the sample, a single precipitate concentrates the shear strain around its surface, eventually causing the failure of the nanowire.",

TiO2 NRs produce direct electrical pathways of photogenerated carriers as well as large surface areas between NRs. This work presents a synthesis of vertically-aligned and uniform TiO2 NRs that were hydrothermally grown on a transparent conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate.

The XRD analyses show that the ZnO films on SiO2/Glass substrate are poly-oriented and have a hexagonal wurtzite structure. All thin films exhibit optical transmittance of >80% in the visible range. The increase in film thickness to 270 nm leads to growth of crystallinity and grain size to 35 nm, increase in the transmittance and refractive indexes for both TM and TE modes, and decrease in the bandgap energy. The room temperature photoluminescence (PL) exhibit UV (3.203.23 eV) and green (2.37 eV) emission for all samples. However, the peaks intensity for UV emission gradually decreases which is attributed to decrease in the concentration of photo-carriers, their aggregations and larger amount of energy transfer to the down layer.

The variation in microstructural characteristics and properties of coatings with various thicknesses was investigated. Powders morphology and the microstructure of as-sprayed coatings were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy. The microhardness was measured using a Vickers' indentor. The corrosion behaviour of plasma-sprayed Al2O3 coatings in 1N H2SO4 solution at a temperature of 25C was evaluated by electrochemistry method. Experimental results indicated that surface roughness showed no obvious dependence on the coating thickness. However, the porosity of Al2O3 coating was increased with increased thickness. The enhanced coating thickness also resulted in decreasing microhardness and reduced corrosion resistance. In this study, the Al2O3 coating with thickness of 160m possesses the lowest porosity, the highest hardness and superior corrosion resistance.",

The JuddOfelt theory has been used to predict the transition probabilities, branching ratios and lifetimes for the various excited states of Er3+ ions in 0.5mol% of Er2O3-doped glass. The effect of Er3+ concentration on temperature dependent luminescence has been studied for the wide temperature range from room temperature up to 773K. The fluorescence intensity ratio of the green emissions associated to the two transitions from the thermally coupled 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels to the 4I15/2 level of Er3+ ion has been studied as a function of temperature, and in turn used to determine the thermal sensitivity and relative thermal sensitivity of the glasses. In the present study, the maximum value for the thermal sensitivity of 79104 K1 at 630K has been obtained for the lowest (0.01mol%) concentration of Er2O3-doped glass, one of the highest sensitivity found in the literature and quite close to the theoretical sensitivity calculated from the JuddOfelt theory. The results reveal that the zinc fluorophosphate glass having relatively low concentration of Er3+ ions can be useful as an optical temperature sensor due to their high sensitivity and the absence of radiative energy transfer processes.",

Improvement in the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of the composites can be due to an increase in the matrix shear strength or an increase in the fibermatrix interface strength or both. In this work, we conducted tests to assess the relative contributions of the matrix shear properties and the glass fiberepoxy interface to the ILSS enhancement. Samples of reinforced matrix were prepared by dispersing 0.5% MWNT by weight in epoxy. Both the reinforced resin and neat resin control samples were subjected to identical ultrasonic agitation. Shear properties of the neat epoxy film and the MWNT reinforced epoxy film were investigated using a shear punch tests on miniature specimens (6.4mm diameter, 0.5mm thick). The strength of the fibermatrix interface for both modified and unmodified matrix was also characterized using the microdroplet test.

With increasing temperature, the Yb-lifetime in singly doped glass increased and that in codoped glass decreased.

One is the sequential sensitization that Tm3+ is excited from 3H6 to 1G4 through absorbing three photons transferred from Yb3+ one by one. Another is the cooperative sensitization that two Yb3+ ions form a couple cluster firstly, and then the couple cluster Yb3+ ions transfer their energy to Tm3+ and excite it to 1G4. With the increment of the concentration of Yb3+ ions, the sequential sensitization becomes weak and the cooperative sensitization becomes intense, and the transformation trend of sensitization mechanism with the increment of Yb3+ concentration can be clarified by the introduction of Tb3+ ions in the glass.",

The in situ formation of divalent europium (Eu2+) along with Eu3+ during high temperature synthesis of these glasses under ambient atmosphere has been perceived and was explained through optical basicity model. Frequency down-conversion due to emission of two near infrared photons at around 1m from Yb3+ ions has been realized upon excitation of Eu2+ ions under 286nm and further enhancement of this frequency down-conversion has been observed upon ceramization of these glasses. The precipitation of BaF2 nano-crystals in glassceramics causes reduction of Eu3+ ions to Eu2+ ions resulting in an enhancement in the cooperative energy transfer from Eu2+ to Yb3+. The weak contribution of Eu3+ excitation towards Yb3+ emission has been attributed to the cross-relaxation process via 5D0  7F6 (Eu3+):2F5/2  2F7/2 (Yb3+) route.

Large compressive plasticity accompanied by strong work-hardening capacity was achieved in the Cu47Zr48Al4Ni1 composite with a volume fraction of crystalline phases of 33%. The excellent compressive properties were mainly attributed to the inhibition for the propagation of shear bands by the ductile crystals and deformation induced martensitic transformation of the B2-CuZr phase. However, no obvious global tensile ductility was obtained, due to the mode I fracture toughness and small plastic-zone size of glass matrix. To uncover the shear-band evolution during deformation, finite element simulation was conducted, revealing that the ductile B2 phase can tune the shear-stress distribution and consequently initiate and retard shear bands, which stimulates the multiplication of shear bands. Accordingly, the spacing of B2 CuZr particles is a vital factor dominating the plasticity of CuZr-based MGMCs, especially upon tension.",

However, this replacement was found to incur adverse effects on the mechanical properties of the cement mortar. In this study, CO2 curing was employed to ameliorate these drawbacks. The effect of CO2 curing on both of the mechanical properties and microstructure of the RG incorporated cement mortar was studied by a series of laboratory tests. The results showed that replacement of river sand by 100% RG led to a 37% decrease in compressive strength and a 32% reduction in flexural strength of the mortar samples under conventional curing. Whereas, CO2 curing of these samples significantly enhanced both the compressive and flexural strength, with a more pronounced improvement on the former. Such improvements were further reflected by a decrease in both the water absorption and porosity, and by an enhancement of the microstructure. This is attributed to the fact that compared with the mortar samples prepared with 100% river sand, those prepared with 100% RG had a more porous structure due to the smooth surface of RG and thus a poor bonding between the RG and the cement paste. However, such a porous structure encouraged CO2 gas to penetrate and diffuse more easily into the cementitious matrix, resulting in a higher degree of CO2 curing.",

            "This study investigates inter-metal dielectric (IMD) layer with a perhydro-polysilazane-based inorganic spin-on-glass (PSZSOG) dielectric layer in 100 nm node multilevel metallization technology. When the PSZSOG film is cured in N2 ambient, the via resistance is worsened; the via resistance declines as the number of wafers in sequence increases because the SOG film tends to adsorb a large amount of moisture and forms a porous IMD film structure. However, when it is cured in O2 ambient, optimization by via adhesion degassing can minimize the slot effect and yield good via resistance. In this study, the non-etchback PSZSOG process is integrated by using 100 nm multilevel metallization technology without an expensive high density plasma chemical vapor deposition (HDP CVD) oxide process or modification of design rules. After the SOG curing recipe and degassing condition in the via adhesion film deposition have been optimized, the PSZSOG exhibits excellent planarization, a dense IMD structure and good via resistance performance that is comparable with that of the traditional HDP CVD oxide process.",

Lithium ion conductivity of Li2OB2O3P2O5 glasses was studied in the correlation to the structural variation of glass network by using FTIR and Raman spectroscopy.

The maximum conductivity of this glass system was 1.6107 1 cm1 for 0.45Li2O0.275B2O30.275P2O5 at room temperature. It was shown that the addition of P2O5 reduces the tendency of devitrification and increases the maximum amount of Li2O added into glass former without devitrification. As Li2O and B2O3 contents increased, the conductivity of glass electrolyte increased due to the increase of three-coordinated [BO3] with a non-bridging oxygen (NBO).",

The results show that severe segregation exists in the ingot. After homogenization treatment at 470C for 12h, dissoluble Zn and Mg enriched non-equilibrium phases dissolve into matrix completely and only little indissoluble impurity phases containing Fe and Si elements remain. At the same time, precipitation of nanometer-scaled coherent secondary Al3(Sc, Zr) particles from a supersaturated solid solution occurs. The proper homogenization process is 470C12h. After solution treatment at 470C for 1h, a lot of non-equilibrium T(Mg32(Al,Zn)49) phases formed during hot rolling dissolve into matrix. Aged at 120C, the precipitates gradually transform from coherent GP zones to semi-coherent  phase and incoherent  phase for the duration of aging, exhibiting a typical behavior of aging strengthening. The optimal solution-aging process is solution treated at 470C for 1h, followed by water quenching and then aged at 120C for 24h (peak-aged). Under this condition, the ultimate tensile strength, yield strength and elongation reach 5552MPa, 5244MPa and 12.30.6% respectively.

The influence of curing conditions on the high temperature performance of SCGC was also investigated. For each curing regime, five SCGC mixtures were prepared with recycled glass (RG) which was used to replace natural fine aggregate at the level of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%. After exposure to the elevated temperatures, concrete mass loss, density, water porosity, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) and water sorptivity were determined and then a compressive strength test was conducted. The test results indicate that regardless of the exposure temperature, all the water cured specimens had higher residual strengths and mass losses while the water porosity and water sorptivity values were lower as compared to the corresponding air cured specimens. The incorporation of RG in the concrete mixes helped to maintain the concrete properties after the high temperature exposure due to the melting and resolidification of the recycled glass in the concrete matrix.",

In addition, other effects such as crystalline electric field or disorder contribute to the rich phenomenology found in these compounds. The actual interest is focussed on the compounds where the magnetic order is suppressed at a given critical pressure P C or, in the case of induced chemical pressure, at a critical concentration x C. In this region, corresponding to a zero temperature phase transition, non-Fermi liquid behaviour on the specific heat, resistivity or susceptibility has been found. The first part of this article will be devoted to analyse the mentioned magnetic interactions and to describe the role of the different implied parameters (cell volume, number of electrons, etc). In the second part, we present the CeNi1x Cu x system as an example of the interplay of the mentioned interactions leading to the disappearance of the long-range order. The spin-glass-like phase appearing in this system is discussed considering recent data, which confirm the existence of a cluster-glass behaviour.

A series of uniaxial, deformation-controlled tension tests was performed to study the strength, deformation, and fracture behaviour of thin, narrow plates made of TRC with and without the addition of short fibres. Furthermore, multifilament-yarn pullout and single-fibre pullout tests were carried out to gain a better understanding of the crack-bridging behaviour which suppresses growth and widening of cracks. Pronounced enhancement of first-crack stress was achieved, the value increased by factors of 1.5 and 2 due to the addition of glass and carbon fibres, respectively. While more and finer cracks were observed on the specimens with short fibres added, a moderate improvement in tensile strength was recorded. Water-to-binder ratio influences the matrixfibre bond quality and thus fibre failure mode. While fibre fracture dominated behaviour when matrix M030 (low water-to-binder ratio of 0.30) was used, pronounced pullout behaviour was observed for fibres embedded in the matrix with a higher w/b ratio (M045). Furthermore, it was found that short fibres can also improve the bond between multifilament-yarns and the surrounding matrix by means of new cross-links.",

Three samples were tested at each energy level. The extent of damage was evaluated using ultrasonic C-scan. Results of the study indicate that stitching confined the damage size.

With the increasing pass of MDF, both the size of dynamic recrystallized grains and the amount of precipitated I phase increased. The corrosion resistance of Mg-4Zn-2Gd-0.5Ca alloy became worse after 1 pass of MDF as compared with the as-homogenizated condition because of the precipitation of I phase.

Methods The enrollment criteria of the trial were as follows: pulmonary peripheral nodule less than 2 cm, diagnosis or suspected diagnosis of clinical T1N0M0 carcinoma with ground-glass opacity and lack of evident pleural indentations or vascular convergence on high-resolution computed tomography. Limited-resection (wedge or segment) specimens were intraoperatively examined by frozen section. If the nodule was confirmed as Noguchi type A or B with a resection margin of greater than 1 cm, the incision was sutured and the patient followed up. The median surveillance period was 10 years. Results In a total of 50 enrolled participants, there were two Noguchi type A, 23 type B and 15 type C adenocarcinomas; five atypical adenomatous hyperplasias, four fibroses, and one granuloma. Although there were no patients with recurrence within the first 5 years, in four patients who underwent limited-resection pulmonary adenocarcinoma developed more than 5 years after the initial resection, of either cut-end recurrence or metachronous primary disease. Conclusions Of 26 patients who underwent limited resection, adenocarcinoma developed in four after more than 5 years. These were possibly cut-end recurrences.

The study reveals the impact of the oxygen content of the powder, the process atmosphere and the temperature of the substrate plate on the structural and mechanical properties of the processed material. For clarifying the causes and mechanisms for the formation of defects in molybdenum and tungsten processed by SLM, the samples were examined by x-ray, scanning and transmission electron microscopy including elemental distribution maps and crystallographic analyses by electron backscatter diffraction. Impurities, mainly oxygen, were identified as cause for the predominant defect structure comprising cracks and residual porosity. During processing, oxygen in the form of molybdenum/tungsten oxide, segregates at the grain boundaries, thereby inducing hot cracking. This is due to the lower melting point of the eutectic compared to the matrix phase. Moreover, the oxygen impurities were found to weaken the grain boundaries and thus increasing the risk for cold cracking and leading to a higher Ductile-to-Brittle Transition Temperature (DBTT). Subsequently, the combination of cracks through hot cracking at planar solidified grain boundaries and cold cracking along weakened grain boundaries during rapid cooling from the melting point creates the crack network generally found in molybdenum and tungsten processed by SLM. Also a substrate plate temperature of 1000C does not prevent the formation of cracks in tungsten caused by oxygen segregations.",

Three-point bending tests were performed on 0 and 90 unidirectional glass-fibre/PP laminates with various weight fractions of m-PP in the PP matrix. These tests showed an increase in both longitudinal and transverse flexural strength up to 10 wt% m-PP, whereas at higher weight fractions of m-PP a decrease in flexural strength was observed. No significant influence of m-PP on composite stiffness was observed. Additional mechanical tests on unidirectional glass/PP composites with 0 wt% and 10 wt% m-PP showed only a small increase in fibre-dominated properties such as longitudinal tensile strength and strain, whereas composite properties that are governed by the interphase, such as transverse, shear and compressive strength, showed significant increases as a result of matrix modification and an enhanced interaction between the glass fibres and the PP matrix.",

Two exothermic peaks were observed in the DSC curves. The low temperature one corresponds to the simultaneous precipitation of an icosahedral quasicrystalline phase (I-phase) and the face centered cubic Zr2Ni (FCCZr2Ni) phase in the Zr65Al7.5Ni10Cu12.5Zn5 alloy.

A supersaturated solid solution of all the alloying elements in Fe has formed in the initial stages of milling. This -Fe phase became amorphous on subsequent milling up to 2030h. Further milling, unexpectedly, led to primary crystallization of the amorphous phase resulting in the formation of an (-Fe) phase with a slightly smaller lattice parameter (and lower solute content) than that in the early stages of milling. External annealing of the amorphous phase powder at 700C for 1h led to complete crystallization of the amorphous phase into a mixture of phases including -Fe, ZrFe2, Fe2B, Fe3B, MoB2, FeMo2B2, and at least another unidentified phase.

The experimental program consisted of testing 54 concrete cube specimens prepared according to CSA S802-02 standard. Two main parameters were considered in the experimental investigation: the compressive strength of concrete (from 25.6MPa to 92.4MPa) and the type of rebar (steel, sand-coated GFRP, and helically wrapped GFRP). The test results showed that the interfacial bond strength of the GFRP bars increased as the compressive strength of concrete increased. However, the increasing rate of the bond strength of the GFRP bars with respect to the concrete strength was much smaller than that of the steel bars. The concrete specimens were sawn in half after the test for a closer investigation of the actual mode of bond failure. Visual examination of the specimens showed that bond failure of the steel bar was caused by concrete crushing against the face of the ribs, while bond failure of the GFRP bars occurred not only in the concrete but also in the bars by delamination of the resin-rich outer layer from the fiber core. The average area of the delaminated resin-rich layer of the GFRP bar increased with increasing compressive strength of concrete.",

Methods Five groups of FRC with increased fiber-density were fabricated and two additional groups were prepared by adding silanated barium-silicate glass fillers (0.7m) to the FRC. The unidirectional E-glass fiber rovings were impregnated with light-polymerizable bisGMA-TEGDMA (5050%) resin. The fibers were pulled through a cylindrical mold with an opening diameter of 4.2mm, light cured for 40s and post-cured at elevated temperature. The cylindrical specimens (n =12) were conditioned at room temperature for 2 days before testing with the three-point bending test (Lloyd Instruments Ltd.) adapted to ISO 10477. Fiber-density was analyzed by combustion and gravimetric analyzes. Results ANOVA analysis revealed that by increasing the vol.% fraction of E-glass fibers from 51.7% to 61.7% there was a change of 27% (p <0.05) in the modulus of elasticity, 34% (p <0.05) in the toughness, and 15% (p <0.05) in the load bearing capacity, while there was only 8% (p <0.05) increase in the flexural strength although it was statistically insignificant. The addition of particulate fillers did not improve the mechanical properties. Significance This study showed that the properties of FRC could be improved by increasing fibervolume fraction.

In this study, the structural relaxation enthalpy H rel (the measure of FV amount) is found to increase after adding Nb or Fe to the glass matrix. As a result, a series of centimeter-scale plastic BMGs is fabricated. Among these TiZr-based BMGs, the sample (Ti32.8Zr30.2Cu9Ni5.3Be22.7)0.9Nb10 (at%) possesses the largest plastic strain ( p) of 8.3% and ultimate strength ( max) of 2080MPa. By further precisely tailoring the composition, a TiZr-based BMG matrix composite (BMGMC) (Ti38.8Zr28.8Cu6.2Be16.2Nb10, at%) possessing both the precipitation of -Ti and -Zr dendrites simultaneously has been fabricated. The TiZr-based BMGMC has both the distinguished plastic strain ( p) of 12% and ultimate strength ( max) of 2150MPa. The values of yielding strength ( y) significantly decreased with the increase of suction casting diameter, whereas the work-hardening phenomenon is more obvious. Therefore, a critical size and volume fractions corresponding to the best mechanical properties of TiZr-based BMGMC should exist. The ductile dendrites are crucial to impeding shear band propagation and generating multiple shear bands in the glass matrix. Results indicate that a large amount of lattice distortions, pile-ups of dislocations and shear steps can be attributed to distinguished plasticity, and these constitute the deformation mechanism of TiZr-based BMGMC.",

Purpose The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the surface roughness of different ceramic-glass polymer CAD-CAM materials after 2 different surface treatments and the effect of material, surface treatment, resin cement, and aging on bond strength. Additionally, it was to determine any correlation between the surface roughness and bond strength. Material and methods CAD-CAM ceramic-glass polymer materials, a polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN) (VITA ENAMIC), a resin nanoceramic (Lava Ultimate), and a nanoparticle-filled resin (Cerasmart) (1.5 mm in thickness; n=144) were divided into 2 subgroups in terms of surface treatments: airborne-particle abraded or silica-coated. The surface roughness values of specimens were measured. Composite resin cylinders were prepared and bonded to the restorative specimens using 2 different types of resin cements (dual-polymerizing [DP] and light-polymerizing [LP]). Half of the specimens were stored in distilled water for 24 hours, while the other half were submitted to 5000 thermocycles. The shear bond strength was measured, and the failure modes of the specimens were evaluated. The data were analyzed with ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests (=.05). The correlation between roughness and bond strength values was analyzed using Pearson correlation analysis. Results Material (P=.012) and surface treatment type (P=.031) significantly affected the surface roughness. For bond strength, significant interactions were found among the material type, surface treatment, resin cement, and aging factors (P=.009). No significant correlation was found between roughness and bond strength (P=.943). Conclusions The surface treatment and resin cement type affected the bond strength and surface roughness of tested restorative materials.

They exhibit many similarities with concentrated and re-entrant spin glasses and some with random magnetic anisotropy systems, for which the inhomogeneity of magnetic structure is a characteristic feature. It is suggested that a phase with weak irreversibility, ranging from T  f <2T m , is determined by magnetic clusters. A crossover to a phase with strong irreversibility at the fictitious freezing temperature T  f is deduced from the change of T m(H)-characteristic in conjunction with the onset of magnetic hysteresis. The variance of dipole interaction E 2 dd 1/2 for randomly ordered frozen moments were calculated for the investigated ferrofluids.

We present strong evidence that the CDG phase indeed exists as a generic feature of density wave systems. However, it arises from the competition of the random impurity pinning and the electrostatic intra-CDW interaction which tends to establish a uniform phase at low temperature. The glass transition occurs at the temperature at which the free carriers cannot efficiently screen the phase distortions.

Glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) was also used to improve the flexural and tensile strengths of shotcrete. In total, 76 different mix designs were prepared and tested to determine the setting time, flexural and tensile strength of shotcrete. The mixes were designed based on three influential parameters including GFRP, water/cement (w/c) ratio and the amount of DEA. According to the results, the flexural and tensile strengths of all specimens increased by adding 0.5% of the weight of GFRP. However, both tensile and flexural strengths showed an insignificant reduction by adding DEA to the mixes. The tensile and flexural strengths of specimens decreased slightly by adding DEA in the presence of GFRP. At a certain amount of DEA, the setting time increased twice with increasing the w/c ratio. The results showed a reduction in the shotcrete strength by using DEA. Thus, in the case where both the setting time and shotcrete strength are of great importance, the optimal DEA level is close to 0.3% of the dry weight of cement and 0.5% GFRP.",

Transverse and longitudinal polished sections were examined by scanning electron microscopy and evaluated by computer-assisted image analysis. Physical parameters, including volume % of fibers, their dispersion index and coordination number, were calculated and correlated with mechanical properties. The weaker posts showed more fiber dispersion, higher resin contents, larger numbers of visible defects and reduced fatigue resistance. The flexural strength was inversely correlated with fiber diameter and the flexural modulus was weakly related to coordination number, volume % of fibers and dispersion index. The interfacial adhesion between the silica fibers and the resin matrix was observed to be of paramount importance.",

The oxygen was found to significantly accelerate crystallization from mechanically induced defects for the (GeS2)0.1(Sb2S3)0.9 composition and to sustain the intensity of crystal formation in case of the (GeS2)0.2(Sb2S3)0.8 and (GeS2)0.3(Sb2S3)0.7 compositions. On the other hand, presence of oxygen influenced neither the morphology of the crystallites, nor the actual crystallization model-free and model-based kinetics. Direct microscopic observation confirmed strict surface crystallization for all studied composition. Compositional evolutions of the viscosity data and microscopically determined crystal growth rate curves have shown that it is the exceptionally high crystal growth rate and crystallization tendency (compared to the minor-to-moderate contribution of viscosity itself) that are responsible for the significant influenceability of the (GeS2)0.1(Sb2S3)0.9 crystallization by the presence of oxygen.",

Teeth were loaded and resistance of specimens was measured as the axial compressive load to cause fracture and macroscopic fracture patterns were observed. One way ANOVA revealed a significant difference in fracture resistance (p < 0.001).

            "The properties of thermoplastics are temperature dependent owing to the fact that they are soft when heated and hard when cooled. An increase in temperature reduces the Young's modulus and tensile strength but increases the failure strain, leading to a material more ductile and less stiff. Of particular concern are under-the-hood thermoplastic parts that are required to be functional at elevated temperatures (around 80C) encountered in and around the engine. The thermoplastic oil pan, for example, is subjected to the heat created by the engine, which is transferred via its connection by contact, the circulating oil and the surrounding air. The simulated influence of temperature on the polyamides PA66-GF35 and PA6-i-GF35 in a ribbed structure illustrates their impact resistance and their temperature dependency. The increase in temperature softened each material, which absorbed more impact energy in deformation. The rubber-modified material PA6-i-GF35 absorbed more energy in deflection and deformation compared to PA66-GF35. The brittleness of PA66-GF35 at 20C contributed to broken walls and ribs, whereas the toughness of PA6-i-GF35 allowed progressive damage on the structure, with ribs that absorbed the impact energy by crushing. PA6-i-GF35 also allowed larger distribution of the impact loading, which resulted in a reduced peak load compared to PA66-GF35 in the range of temperature studied (20 to 120C).",

The 1.06 m emission intensity increases firstly and then attains maximum at 0.5 mol% Nd2O3 and decreases with further increase of dopant concentration. The luminescence quenching behavior at higher Nd3+ concentration has been ascribed to the hopping migration assisted cross relaxation mechanism.

The strategy is to create local structural heterogeneity in Ti-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) by alloying with a soft element which has high negative enthalpy of mixing with Ti-atoms. The GFA of Ti40Zr10Cu36xPd14Gax rods increases with increasing Ga content up to 4at.%, and for more Ga it decreases. Minor addition of Ga (x=2) is beneficial to improve the strength and ductility of the TiZrCuPd-based BMG due to the formation of local structural heterogeneities which facilitate the formation of a highly organized pattern of multiple shear bands under quasi-static compression. Ti40Zr10Cu34Pd14Ga2 BMG shows the best combination of compressive global strain and maximum compressive strength of 4.5% and 2000MPa, respectively. Comparing the Young's modulus of Ga-containing alloys in amorphous and crystalline state we find that the amorphous state shows significant elastic softening (4048% smaller) which is useful to reduce stress shielding effect for biomedical applications.

Purpose The objective of this study was to record the fracture strength of endodontically treated teeth restored with glass fiber reinforced or cast gold post and cores cemented with 3 cements. Material and methods Forty-two single-rooted premolars with standardized weakened roots were endodontically treated and allocated to 6 experimental groups (n=7) defined by the 2 factors investigated: post system and cement. Three groups were restored with glass fiber posts and resin-modified glass ionomer cement, dual-polymerizing resin cement, or chemically active autopolymerizing resin cement. The other 3 groups were restored with cast gold post and cores and the same 3 cements. The cores of the glass fiber post groups were fabricated with composite resin core material. Metal crowns were cemented on the cores in the 6 groups. The entire system was subjected to continuous compression in a universal testing machine, and fracture limit and location (cervical third, middle third, or apical third) were noted. Two-way ANOVA and the Scheff test were used to analyze the data and compare the groups (=.05). Results Two-way ANOVA showed significant differences in the post type (P<.001) and the cements (P<.001). The interaction between them (P<.001) was statistically significant in the fracture resistance of the endodontically treated teeth.

Addition of 0.5wt.% Ca did not form any new phase but suppressed the discontinuous precipitation of the -Mg17Al12 phase by being dissolved in both the second phase and magnesium matrix. In the materials containing higher amounts of Ca, however, the Al2Ca phase with a lamellar morphology appeared in the microstructure and the volume fraction of -Mg17Al12 diminished. It was found that Ca generally refines the microstructure and enhances the thermal stability of the alloy. This was documented by the retention of the initial fine dendritic microstructure, hardness, and ultimate shear strength (USS) of the Ca-containing materials after long-term annealing at 673K. The observed improvements are believed to be caused by the solid solution strengthening of Ca in the Mg matrix, and the particle strengthening effects of the thermally stable Al2Ca phase which are formed as an interconnected network. This behavior is in contrast to that of the base material which developed a coarse grain structure with decreased strength and hardness after the same thermal treatment.",

The glass powder residue (GPR) was used as partial replacement up to 50% by weight in cement pastes to evaluate the potential use of this matrix for application in fiber cement composites. For mortar specimens, the percentage of substitution of cement (up to 20% by weight) was used to evaluate the applicability of the glass powder in masonry construction. Primarily, several experiments such as thermogravimetric analysis, compressive strength tests, pozzolanic activity and durability tests were carried out to evaluate the potential use of GPR in cement industry. Secondly, to evaluate the eco-efficiency of the material elaborated, the energy demand of cement partially replaced by glass powder residue and the energy performance of mortars were calculated using mathematical equations. The results showed that GPR presents a pozzolanic activity and a free calcium hydroxide cement matrix is obtained when the ordinary Portland cement is partially replaced by 50% by weight of GPR in cement pastes. Moreover, the partial replacement of cement by 10% by weight of GPR leads to an increase of physico-mechanical properties of mortars. Finally, the energy consumption per MPa of mortars partially replaced by GPR (10 and 20% by weight) is lower than the one of original Portland cement suggesting the eco-efficiency of GPR for applications in cement production and the elaboration of cementitious materials. According to the results of the study, the residue from polishing process of flat glass can be used for the elaboration of green cement and eco-efficient cementitious materials.",

It was found that the phosphate network of these glasses is composed of middle (Q2) and branching (Q3) phosphate tetrahedra, whereas germanium part in the network is composed of three- or four-membered GeO4 tetrahedral rings. It was also found that the germanium tetrahedral are randomly connected to either Q2 or Q3 phosphate units in the network. The glass network, especially the Q2 units can be modified by the presence of Na ions. This modification is primarily associated with the phosphate. It is found that these glasses behave as if they are formed from a solution of GeO2 and sodiumphosphate glass with various GeO4 units and the Q2 and Q3 phosphate units randomly distributed in the network.",

It has been observed that the structural evolution of these glasses with increase of B2O3 content is not similar to that of undoped silver borophosphate glasses. The addition of AgI in silver borophosphate glasses affects the mixed glass former effect. FTIR spectra show that the phosphate glass network is continuously modified in the entire compositional range due to incorporation of B2O3. The network connectivity between the borate and phosphate network depends on the formation of POB linkages and the concentration of three dimensionally connected P3 and B4 units. The compositional dependence of the glass transition temperature depends on network connectivity of the mixed glass formers.

Comparing the effect of various oxide additions to molybdenum, a correlation between the percentage of ionic bonding character of the oxide and the recrystallization temperature of the ODS-Mo could be found, owing to particle refining during deformation and heat treatment. For hard glass sealing the particle multiplication factor should be as high as possible (e.g. Mo-La2O3) in order to achieve ductility after the pinch-sealing operation. Quartz glass sealing demands an ESS-ribbon with a recrystallization temperature in the range of 1250 C. A higher recrystallization temperature leads to higher stresses in the quartz glass (higher risk of quartz cracks), a lower recrystallization temperature results in a reduced yield owing to cracks in the ESS-ribbon. A good adherence between the ESS-ribbon and the quartz glass, which is a prerequisite for a long-term vacuum tight seal, is determined by mechanical bonding, chemical bonding, wettability and surface purity of the ESS-ribbon. The Y2O3-Ce2O3 particles in MY (Mo-0.47 wt% Y2O3-0.08 wt% Ce2O3) which are surrounded by etching grooves lead to a zip-fastener effect (improved mechanical bonding), a reduced wetting angle (pure Mo: 97.2  6.5 , MY: 79.7  8.5 ; T = 2000 dgC, Ar) and the formation of Y2Si2O7.

The fatigue behaviour of the aged material has been investigated at different strain levels, frequencies and strain ratios. The results demonstrate that the stiffness loss exhibits some of the main characteristic features which can be deduced from the delayed failure of a statistical population of glass fibres by a S.C.C. mechanism.

Copper mold casting and melt-spinning methods have been applied to study the influence of the cooling rate on the properties of both alloys, Ti75Zr10Si15 and Ti60Zr10Nb15Si15. As a result of different cooling rates, significant microstructural variations from multiphase crystalline states in cast rods to nanocomposite structures in ribbons were observed. The limited glass-forming ability (GFA) of the Ti75Zr10Si15 alloy results for melt-spun ribbons mainly in nanocomposite structures with -type nanocrystals being embedded in a glassy matrix. Addition of Nb increases the glass-forming ability. Raising the overheating temperature of the melt prior to melt-spinning from 1923 K to 2053 K yields for both alloys a higher amorphous phase fraction. The mechanical properties were investigated using compression tests (bulk samples) and the nano-indentation technique. A decrease of hardness (H), ultimate stress and reduced Young's modulus (E r) is observed for Ti60Zr10Nb15Si15 rods as compared to Ti75Zr10Si15 ones. This is attributed to an increase of the fraction of the -type phase.
